# 03 Javascript: Password Generator

This web app will generate a random password for the user. The user will get a prompt to set the length of the password, anywhere from 8 to 128. The user will have the option to select uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and/or special characters. At least one character type must be selected or the app will ask to try again. The user then will be given a unique password based on the options chosen.
